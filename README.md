# BEARS
### Senior Capstone Project for Middlesex County Academy, made by Stephanie Almeida and Steven Abreu

BEARS or the Bullying, Exploitation, and Abuse Recognition Systems is an artificial intelligence system which is able to detect
if a child is being bullied through a two-way conversation with the child. If the system suspects that the child is being bullied,
it begins recording the conversation and uploads it to a database where an adult who is responsible for the child can access it
through logging in to our website.

Our project employs the usage of the following technologies:
1. Python
2. MongoDB
3. Node.js
4. IBM Watson Speech-to-Text API
5. IBM Watson ToneAnalyzer API
6. Raspberry Pi
7. CAD Software
